    <h1>Freeskates Tricktionary</h1>
    <h2>for all your freeskating lingo needs</h2>

    <div class="">
      <h3 id="stances">Stances</h3>
        <h4>Regular</h4>
        <p>Left foot is leading. Right foot is the back foot.</p>

        <h4>Goofy</h4>
        <p>Right foot is leading. Left foot is the back foot.</p>

        <h4>Switch</h4>
        <p>The opposite of your normal stance. For a skater who rides Regular, switch means right foot leading.
          For a skater who rides Goofy, switch means left foot leading.</p>

        <h4>Crossfoot / Tokyo</h4>
        <p>There are several variations. The default is when your back foot crosses frontside of your front foot.</p>

        <h4>Fakie</h4>
        <p>This is a term in skateboarding for when you're riding switch but
          your body is oriented away from your direction of motion. Since
          freeskates are more symmetrical, the term fakie doesn't have the same
          meaning. You may hear people use Fakie as an alternative to Switch.</p>

        <h4>Frontside</h4>
        <p>The direction that your belly button points in. When referring to a
           spin, such as "a frontside 180", frontside means the belly button is
           pointing towards the outside of the circle. When referring to a throw
           trick, frontside means the skate spends most of the duration of the
           trick on the frontside.</p>

        <h4>Backside</h4>
        <p>The direction that your back points in. When referring to a
           spin, such as "a backside 180", backside means the belly button is
           pointing towards the inside of the circle. When referring to a throw
           trick, backside means the skate spends most of the duration of the
           trick on the backside.</p>
